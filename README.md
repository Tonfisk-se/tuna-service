# tuna-service

The principal repository for Tonfisk.se

# What the frick is this? 

you, who have recieved an invite may wonder. Well, Tonfisk.se is an open-source web service originated from 
the founders' fascination for the Tuna and its return to the coastal waters of Sweden. 
The vision of Tonfisk.se is for it to be a full open-source web service used to monitor, and eventually predict, 
geographic occurence of tunas in the Ã–resund strait and along the West Coast of Sweden. 

# What needs to be done? 

We have yet no clue whatsover. The idea so far is to set up some form of website where the public 
can pin locations for where they have seen Tunas in Sweden. For this we need some sort of

* Front-end, perhaps just a HTML-CSS-JavaScript web app?
* A  SQL database where we can store all the data.
* At some later stage a back-end where we can  perform cool stuff (Statistics! ML!) on our
  gathered data.
* An AWS or GCP cluster where our service and database can be hosted. Perhaps, we also want the
  service to containerized, so perhaps Docker?

Oh, and one very important piece of this project is to come up with very, very cool names for our
various repos/services.

# Prerequisities 

What are the prerequisites for me to participate? 

None! All you need to do is to come as you are! Perhaps, contemplate a bit beforehand 
what you'd want to work with, or learn about, whether it's DevOps, front-end or back-end development or 
enhance your SQL-skills. 

The main idea of this is to be a fun, friendly project where you can get the chance of diving into some 
area of Software development that you are interested in and want to learn, but don't have time to do at your 
everyday workplace. Or don't find the motivation to dig into by yourself outside work hours. 

# When do we kick-off? 

You are invited to Tonfisk.se's GlÃ¶gghackathon taking place at either 17/12 11:00, depending 
on when most people can participate. The place will be either Erik's or Johan's place, both in MalmÃ¶. 

What if I can't make it? 
Don't worry, there will be more events and the work with the service will be ongoing for a long time. 
More events will be announced in the beginning of next year. 

Hope to see you soon! ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ…
